1. [Time series forecasting using ARIMA models](https://blogs.oracle.com/datascience/introduction-to-forecasting-with-arima-in-r)

    This example is important because it introduces the forecasting methodology using ARIMA models in R. The steps are:
    
    + 1. Examine your data
   +  2. Decompose your data
   + 3. Stationarity
   + 4. Autocorrelations and choosing model order
   + 5. Fit an ARIMA model
   + 6. Evaluate and iterate
    

2. [Forecasting with Simple Linear Regression] (https://library.tradingtechnologies.com/trade/chrt-ti-linear-regression-forecast.html)


   Linear regression which is statistical tool used to help predict unknown values from known values is the most common fundamental type of R analysis. The main aim is predicting the value of a single numeric variable based on one or more variables that can be either numeric or categorical. 
   
   
3. Simple Exponential Smoothing Technique in R (SES)
4. Hidden Markov
